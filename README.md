# NS2-Final
## COPY AT YOUR OWN RISK
This NS-2 simulation is mainly for- 
```
      1. Wired 
      2. Wireless(Static) 802.11. 
```  
For bonus I completed-
```
      1. Satellite
      2. Wired to wireless
      3. Queue size monitoring
      4. Per node throughput calculation. 
```

Modifications in CPP files I made - 
```
      1. TCP congestion control (tcp.cc)
      2. Random AODV Routing protocol (aodv.cc)
      3. RTT calculation mechanism (tcp.cc)
```
For routing protocol modification, I used a paper on RAODV (Random AODV). 

For tcp congestion window modification and rtt calculation, I used simple intuitions. 

All modified files and my whole ns installation folder in home directory is given here. Understand it carefully before implementing it. 
Necessary books and papers are also given here.
